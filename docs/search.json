    "text": "Case 001: Bigfoot\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nAre Bigfoot sightings geographically clustered in specific regions or habitats? as a believer in Bigfoot In interested in seeing where they are mostly located. I will be using data from Bigfoot sighting in the United States to determine some of the sightings and their coloration with their respected regions. I will want to see if those sightings have changed over the years, in order to understand if those regions aren’t as suitable as they used to be.\nMy honest prediction is that we will usually find sasqautches in nice forest or mountain terrains due to them resembling that of a giant ape. What we know about apes is that they need need a nice rain-forest climate and terrain, these creatures will have better chances at surviving in a tropical region than a dessert region. But id like to think that slowly as we uncover more recent sightings we will see a shift in those regions. Since some animals have to migrate in order to adapt and survive and due to human activity, climate change or other factors. I believe that some of these newer sightings will show some Sasquatches in areas that don’t seem like a preferable place for a giant ape.\nI will be using Bigfoot Sightings data from Kaggle collected by the foot Field Researchers Organization\n\n\n\nApproach\n\nThe data used for this project comes from Kaggle and it is called Bigfoot Sightings made by Tim Renner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data was collected from BigfootFieldResearchersOrganization which contains sighting details including report numbers along with classification titles depicting incident nature such as direct sighting or tracks found etc.\n\nthe data set includes three files, I will be using bfro_reports_geocoded.csv\nbfro_report_locations.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nobserved\nThe date and time of the sighting.

Most of the dots are in places with lots of trees and mountains which tells us that it behaves like an actual ape. as we look at the map below we can see the different types of biomes in the United States and can see they have mostly been seen in tropical biomes.

I think that when the first video was captured of Bigfoot via the Patterson films in 1967 it gave rise to the Sasquatch and thus it got so popular that people began claim that they’ve seen something like it. Which leads be to say that some of the sightings that are presented on this map might not be totally accurate.\nGigantopithecus:\n\n\n\n\n\nberingia:\n\n\n\n\n\ncoelacanth: 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nMost of these Bigfoot sightings happen in forest and mountain areas, which confirms my suspicion that Bigfoot might be less than a myth and legend and rather more of an undiscovered type of ape.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe map shows that most Bigfoot sightings happen in places with lots of trees and mountains, like Washington, Oregon, and Northern California. This matches my idea that Bigfoot likes to live in forests and mountains, just like big apes do. But, some sightings also happen in places where you wouldn’t expect Bigfoot, like parts of the Midwest and the Southeast. Maybe Bigfoot is moving to new places, or people are seeing things by mistake.\nI now believe more in the theory that Bigfoot is a descendant of Gigantopithecus blacki due to it liking places with lots of trees and food. Also due to the fact that it does not get into hot places such as dessert or grasslands as it would rather prefer trees.\nI strongly believe in my hypothesis because the map shows most sightings in forests and mountains and other grassy terrains. However I am getting ahead of myself since we should look more at how sightings change over time and with weather or land type. Could this be caused by global warming? less food choices? or human activity?\nI don’t believe in my idea less, however there are some things that make me question my own data. Since some sightings due appear to be in weird places, some sightings could have been fabricated or people could have seen something else. The human brain does tend to trick their own mind to see something that wasn’t there in the first place"

    "title": "Using this quarto course blog template",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a template for using quarto to create a course blog. A course blog can be used in many ways to engage with course content. For example, you could use the blog to post assignments, or to dive more deeply into course material that interests you. By the end of the course, your blog can serve as a portfolio of ways that you engaged in the material. By learning how to use quarto for your blog, you will also be learning new skills for creating and sharing reproducible documents that could be useful to you in the future.\nThe purpose of this page is to provide tips and pointers about blogging with quarto. Quarto is simple enough for creating a basic course blog. However, it is also very deep and can be used to create all sorts of documents, from website, to slide decks, and books.\n\n\nMany questions about quarto can be answered from the quarto documentation located at: https://quarto.org.\nIf you are looking for something specific and don’t know where to find it on the website, use the search tool in the top right corner.\n\n\n\n\nTo use this template you will need a Github.com account, and access to R and Rstudio.\nYou can get access by creating a Github.com account, and downloading the necessary open-source software to your machine.\nIt is also possible to use Rstudio in your web-browser, which does not require downloading any software. There are two sets of instructions, one for the downloading approach, and the other for using Rstudio cloud. Scroll to the bottom for instructions on using Rstudio cloud.\n\n\n\nIn order to use this template you will need to install some free open-source software on your computer.\n\nSign up for a free account at https://github.com. This a website for sharing open-source software, but it can also be used to serve your blog as a website for free.\nDownload Github Desktop and install it on your machine. This should install the version control software git on your system, and you can use Github Desktop to easily push your blog from your local computer so that it can be viewed on Github.com.\nDownload R and install it on your machine. R is a programming language capable of many things, and it needs to be on your machine before you can run R Studio.\nDownload R Studio Desktop and install it on your machine. R Studio is called an “IDE” or integrated development environment, that you can use to write your blog with quarto.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have the software installed, the next step is to create a quarto blog project in R studio. The collection of files in this template is a pre-made quarto blog project that you can modify for your own purposes. You can also make one yourself in Rstudio.\nAssuming you have downloaded this template, and you have installed the above software, then you need to open quartoCourseBlog.Rproj.\n\n\n\n\nTo find out if everything is working, try rendering the blog. Go to the “Build” Tab and press “Render Website”.\n\nAfter the rendering is complete, you should be able to view your blog. It might show up in the viewer pane like this:\n\nAnd if you press the ‘window-with-an-arrow’ button, you can view the website in your default browser. Quarto websites automatically adjust for the size of the window, so it may appear differently in the viewer pane versus the browser.\n\n\n\nAll of the blog posts are located in the posts folder.\n\nTo make a new post, copy an existing post and then modify it. For example, my posts folder currently contains one post, and it is inside the my_first_post folder.\n\nI can copy the folder and make a new one with the same contents from the Rstudio gear-box menu:\n\nI made a folder for a second post called Example_assignment.\n\nThese are the two files inside the folder. The .qmd file is a plain text file where you will write the blog post. This folder can also be used to store other assets you might put in the post, such as pictures.\n\n\n\nTo write a new post, open the .qmd file, edit the text, and then re-render the website. This is what the text in the .qmd file looked like when I copied it.\n\nThe text at the top between the “---” is called YAML, and provides meta-data for your document. This is where you can change the title, date, name, and add keywords if you want.\nThe rest of the document is for the main body of the post. For example, I changed the text to read:\n\n\n\n\n\nRender the website from the build tab again to see your new post.\n\n\n\nTo share your blog online you will have to publish it on a server that can be accessed by other people on the internet. There are multiple ways to do this step, and I recommend using Github pages. You can view more in-depth instructions from quarto here https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html.\nHere are the steps:\n\nOpen Github Desktop\nGo to preferences and sign in to your Github.com account\n“Add” your blog project folder to Github Desktop\nThere should be an option for a commit message, write a note in there like “first commit”.\nPublish to github.com and uncheck private repository so that other people will be able to see your repository.\nYou should now be able to see your new repository in your github.com profile, which means you should be able to see a copy of your blog files in the repository.\nActivate Github pages for your repository (under repository settings), and serve the page from the “docs” folder.\nAccess the blog from the url generated by the github pages settings page.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever you make changes to your blog project that you want to share online follow these steps:\n\nMake changes to your blog, like writing a new post, or editing an old one.\nRender the website in R-studio. What you see here should be what you will see later on Github.com\nOpen Github Desktop and Commit your changes, by writing brief commit title, and pressing commit.\nThen, use Github Desktop to Push your changes to github.com.\nWait half a minute or so, and you should see your new content appear on the website.\n\n\n\n\nI am planning to add a video overview of these steps soon. In the meantime, these instructions may be enough to get started with R studio cloud and github.com.\n\nSign up for a free account with posit cloud here https://posit.cloud/plans/free\nSign up for a free https://github.com account.\nLog in to Github, and search for this repository https://github.com/CrumpLab/quartoCourseBlog.\n\n\nClick the green “Use this template” Button\nThis will make a copy of the template in your github account, it will show up as one of your repositories\nGive your new repository a name\n\n\nActivate Github pages for your repository (under repository settings), and serve the page from the “docs” folder. You should now be able to view the blog from the url given by github pages.\nLog into Posit Cloud\nCreate a New Project, choose “New Project from Git Repository”\n\n\nenter the URL to the github repository you just made\n\n\nLoad the project, and edit/modify the files (see above for examples of creating new posts etc.)\nTo send your changed files back to github.com you need to do a few steps\n\n\nFrom the Git tab: stage your changes, commit your changes, and push your changes using the green up arrow.\nYou will also need to authenticate your git credentials, and allow Rstudio cloud to update your github repository\nIn the terminal run these two lines, but replace with your name and email\n\n\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\n\nWhen you “push” your changes back to Github using the green up arrow, you will be asked to enter a username and password. You can enter the username for your Github.com account, but your password won’t work. You need to set up a personal access token.\nGo to your github.com profile &gt; settings page. Scroll down, click on “&lt;&gt; Developer Settings”, on the left\nClick on personal access tokens, generate a new token, give it repo access. Save the text somewhere and use it as your github password when pushing from RStudio.\n\n\nAt this point you should be able to work on your blog in Rstudio Cloud, and push your changes to have them updated on github.com, which serves your blog online.\n\n\n\n\nSee this growing list of quarto resources for much, much more:\nhttps://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto"

You should now be able to view the blog from the url given by github pages.\nLog into Posit Cloud\nCreate a New Project, choose “New Project from Git Repository”\n\n\nenter the URL to the github repository you just made\n\n\nLoad the project, and edit/modify the files (see above for examples of creating new posts etc.)\nTo send your changed files back to github.com you need to do a few steps\n\n\nFrom the Git tab: stage your changes, commit your changes, and push your changes using the green up arrow.\nYou will also need to authenticate your git credentials, and allow Rstudio cloud to update your github repository\nIn the terminal run these two lines, but replace with your name and email\n\n\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\n\nWhen you “push” your changes back to Github using the green up arrow, you will be asked to enter a username and password. You can enter the username for your Github.com account, but your password won’t work. You need to set up a personal access token.\nGo to your github.com profile &gt; settings page. Scroll down, click on “&lt;&gt; Developer Settings”, on the left\nClick on personal access tokens, generate a new token, give it repo access. Save the text somewhere and use it as your github password when pushing from RStudio.\n\n\nAt this point you should be able to work on your blog in Rstudio Cloud, and push your changes to have them updated on github.com, which serves your blog online."
