Case 001: Bigfoot

![](hand-drawn-bigfoot-silhouette_23-2150279807.avif)

# Introduction

-   Are Bigfoot sightings geographically clustered in specific regions or habitats? as a believer in Bigfoot In interested in seeing where they are mostly located. I will be using data from Bigfoot sighting in the United States to determine some of the sightings and their coloration with their respected regions. I will want to see if those sightings have changed over the years, in order to understand if those regions aren't as suitable as they used to be.

-   My honest prediction is that we will usually find sasqautches in nice forest or mountain terrains due to them resembling that of a giant ape. What we know about apes is that they need need a nice rain-forest climate and terrain, these creatures will have better chances at surviving in a tropical region than a dessert region. But id like to think that slowly as we uncover more recent sightings we will see a shift in those regions. Since some animals have to migrate in order to adapt and survive and due to human activity, climate change or other factors. I believe that some of these newer sightings will show some Sasquatches in areas that don't seem like a preferable place for a giant ape.

    I will be using Bigfoot Sightings data from Kaggle collected by the foot Field Researchers Organization

# Approach

-   The data used for this project comes from Kaggle and it is called Bigfoot Sightings made by [Tim Renner](https://data.world/timothyrenner)

[![](/images/Tim.png){fig-align="center"}](https://data.world/timothyrenner)

-   The data was collected from BigfootFieldResearchersOrganization which contains sighting details including report numbers along with classification titles depicting incident nature such as direct sighting or tracks found etc.

    [![](/images/bionics_v1_1213.jpg)](https://www.bfro.net/)

-   the data set includes three files, I will be using bfro_reports_geocoded.csv

-   There are currently 6 columns as the file includes number that has a maximum of 4251 rows, title, classification the determines if they are a class A or class B, longitude and latitude for the coordinates of the sighthing , and a time stamp to tell us the date of the sighting.

# Tools

-   Programming Language: R
-   IDE: RStudio (Posit.Cloud)

# Approach/Predictions

-   Filter the data that focuses on sightings within the United States.

-   Map the geographic sightings using latitude and longitude coordinates.

-   Analyze how the location sightings have changed over time.

-   Examine the relationship between sightings and environmental factors such as terrain type (forest, mountain, desert).

-   Repeat your predictions, but with more specificity (e.g.Â *I predict that residents will have at least 1 point higher median score on the subjective-well being score than commuters*).

Description: This picture shows all the places where people said they saw Bigfoot in the U.S. The purple dots show the sightings, from different time period. Most of the dots are in places with lots of trees and mountains which tells us that it behaves like an actual ape. as we look at the map below we can see the different types of biomes in the United States and can see they have mostly been seen in tropical biomes. Which kind of proves my theory of them being primates.

```

Description: the dots represent the different time periods in which the sightings became more popular. I think that when the first video was captured of Bigfoot via the Patterson films in 1967 it gave rise to the Sasquatch and thus it got so popular that people began claim that they've seen something like it. Which leads be to say that some of the sightings that are presented on this map might not be totally accurate.

#### Conclusion:

Most of these Bigfoot sightings happen in forest and mountain areas, which confirms my suspicion that Bigfoot might be less than a myth and legend and rather more of an undiscovered type of ape.

# Discussion

-   The map shows that most Bigfoot sightings happen in places with lots of trees and mountains, like Washington, Oregon, and Northern California. This matches my idea that Bigfoot likes to live in forests and mountains, just like big apes do. But, some sightings also happen in places where you wouldnât expect Bigfoot, like parts of the Midwest and the Southeast. Maybe Bigfoot is moving to new places, or people are seeing things by mistake.

-   I now believe more in the theory that Bigfoot is a descendant of Gigantopithecus blacki due to it liking places with lots of trees and food. Also due to the fact that it does not get into hot places such as dessert or grasslands as it would rather prefer trees.

-   I strongly believe in my hypothesis because the map shows most sightings in forests and mountains and other grassy terrains. However I am getting ahead of myself since we should look more at how sightings change over time and with weather or land type. Could this be caused by global warming? less food choices? or human activity?

-   I don't believe in my idea less, however there are some things that make me question my own data. Since some sightings due appear to be in weird places, some sightings could have been fabricated or people could have seen something else. The human brain does tend to trick their own mind to see something that wasn't there in the first place
